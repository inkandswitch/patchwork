# @inkandswitch/patchwork-bootloader

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e6afa48: Add `@inkandswitch/patchwork-bootloader/site` entry point exporting
  `bootPatchworkSite(config)`, a full browser-app boot sequence that constructs
  the Repo, wires the service-worker port, loads plugins via the ModuleWatcher,
  resolves the user's account, and installs URL-hash routing + dev globals. This
  lets per-site `main.ts` collapse to a ~10-line config object and keeps two
  sibling sites from drifting apart.

  Also removes the unused `@inkandswitch/patchwork-bootloader` devDependency from
  `@inkandswitch/patchwork-plugins`, which eliminated a cyclic workspace edge.
