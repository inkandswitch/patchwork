Configure Subduction or Keyhive with exclusive `syncServers` configuration. `syncServers.keyhive` replaces the `keyhive` and `keyhiveSyncServer` site options and the runtime `setup({ keyhive })` option. Selecting a named ARK relay or providing a custom relay identity and URL enables Keyhive, and configured server URLs now control worker connections as well as connection hints.
